- searchKeywords: Key terms that would be useful for searching social media posts
- isEventSearch: true if they're asking about places to go, things to do, or activities (be generous in interpretation)

Examples:
- "where do undergraduates go for bars in kenya" ‚Üí location: "kenya", eventType: ["bars"], targetAudience: ["undergraduates", "students"], isEventSearch: true
